                I have understood the nature and aims of the Foodback initiative and why I am invited to contribute. I have had the opportunity to ask questions and have them answered to my satisfaction. I have had sufficient time to think about using the app and to talk about it with the person(s) of my choice.
                <br>
                <br>
                I agree to take part in the collection of data related to my local community food environment through this Foodback smartphone application including 8 different features (‘your supermarket’, ‘your fast food’, ‘your food outlets’, ‘your school food zone’, ‘your hospital, ‘your community, ‘your sport clubs and events’ and ‘your activity environment’)
                <br>
                <br>
                I accept that no reimbursement of working hours or travel costs will be made for my contribution in this initiative
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that the time I invest in the Foodback initiative for creating healthier food environments is completely up to me
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that I am free to withdraw participation at any time and to withdraw any data collected by me from the online web platform. In order to withdraw any data collected by me, I have to send an email request to foodback@auckland.ac.nz
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that the data collected by me will be confidential and no personal data and details will be posted on the interactive Foodback website platform. Only summary data on schools, retailers and sport clubs in my community will be accessible.
                <br>
                <br>
                No identifiable information from participants will be reported in any format, whether through the online web platform, feedback to local stakeholders or through publication of the findings.
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that the data collected by me will be kept in order to make comparisons between communities and over time.
                <br>
                <br>
                I agree not to execute any pressure on schools or retailers to participate in the study and to leave those properties whenever requested to do so.
                <br>
                <br>
                I understand that for the Foodback app features related to ‘Your school food zone’ or ‘Your workplace’, I have to ask a representative to sign an online consent form (realsignatures to be collected through smartphone or tablet) with mention of the role of the person who signs, before they collect any data through the smartphone application about the environment and the nutrition policy. These signed consent forms will be automatically posted, registered and stored on the web platform, so that the researchers can keep track of the premises that have given consent. For private sector settings and other public sector settings not mentioned in the uploaded list, it will be possible to add them, together with their address, signed consent form and role of the signing person onto the same website.
                <br>
                <br>
                I will not upload pictures which also have individuals photographed on them. These pictures will be deleted from the database if they contain (parts of) individuals.
