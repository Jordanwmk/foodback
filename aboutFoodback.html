            Foodback is a new initiative to empower people for healthier 
            community food places. It involves the development of a smartphone 
            app for crowdsourcing data on the healthiness of foods advertised 
            and sold in local community settings (i.e., schools, hospitals, supermarkets, 
            takeaways, sport clubs) and outdoors (i.e., around schools). The results will be 
            fed back automatically to local ‘change agents’ (such as local Government 
            representatives, local Members of Parliament, schools, retailers, sport clubs,..) 
            in the form of health star ratings. This way, settings and communities can be 
            compared against each other, and people can encourage and support local ‘change 
            agents’ to make positive, healthy changes to foods advertised and sold in their 
            community. Registration information will include: sex, age, ethnicity, community, 
            email, and mobile phone number. Your location based on your mobile device will also 
            be captured. You will also be required to use your mobile device’s camera for 
            this application.
